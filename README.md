# Carbon Credit Tracking using Blockchain
The project employs blockchain and Web 3.0 technologies including smart contracts and decentralized identities to develop
a transparent and efficient system for handling carbon credits. Tokenization facilitates trade. The decentralized
identification and oracle functionality improve privacy, security, and real-time data accuracy, resulting in a robust and
inclusive solution to transparent carbon credit tracking.
